# Lightweight Stock Chart Demo

This React project demonstrates a small stock charting interface built with the TradingView lightweight‑charts library. A simple navigation bar allows selecting a primary stock symbol and an optional comparison symbol.

Sample data for AAPL and MSFT is included. The chart displays candlesticks for the main symbol and a red line for the comparison symbol when provided. A small text section below the chart shows a description for the selected stock.

To run the project locally you will need internet access because the lightweight‑charts library is loaded from a CDN.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`
